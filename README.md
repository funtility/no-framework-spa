# Funtility Subdomain

The purpose of this template is to provide an easy to implement project starter for a basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript web site. The inspiration behind this is to create fun projects with completely open code for anyone to learn from or use in their own projects.

This template also includes unused, commented, code designed for creating a PWA (Progressive Web Application). More info about creating a PWA can be found here. [A Beginner's Guide To Progressive Web Apps](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/a)
